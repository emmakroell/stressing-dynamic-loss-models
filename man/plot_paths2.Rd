\title{plot a RPS object (better for paper)
creates two plots: the first shows elect paths under the stressed model,
along with the chosen quantiles under P and Q, the seconf shows the
corresponding intensity paths udner Q}

\item{Npaths}{int, number of paths to plot}

\item{quantiles}{list containing lower and upper, specifies which quantiles
to highlight}
